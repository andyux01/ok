<grid-plate disable-responsive layout="2-1"><h2 data-design-treatment="vert" data-primary="15" slot="col-1">Scanning Process / Software</h2><p slot="col-1" role="textbox">The following stages of the process involves aligning the various scans to create
    a coherent, detailed 3D model using Artec Studio 17 software. The point cloud is
    converted into a mesh, which is a solid 3D model, and the texture data captured by
    the scanner is mapped back onto the mesh to add color, markings, and other details.
    The final 3D model can be exported into other software platforms, such as Blender
    and Instant Mesh, both of which are open-source.</p>

    <p ="true"="" slot="col-1">To optimize the model for web use, it must be reduced significantly in size. To
    achieve this, the polygon count is reduced using Instant Mesh, and the resulting
    low-polygon model is unwrapped, and the texture and additional details are added
    through a process called “baking” onto the model using normal mapping. This is a
    commonly used technique in film and video game production to reduce file sizes, processing
    power, and other resources required.</p>
